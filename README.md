# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This machine learning project predicts house sale prices based on various features in a housing dataset. We used the Ames Housing dataset and trained a Gradient Boosting Regressor for accurate predictions.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training & evaluation.
- `gradient_boosting_model.pkl`: Trained Gradient Boosting Regressor model.
- `train.csv` & `test.csv`: Training and testing datasets.
- `gbr_submission.csv`: Submission predictions made by the model.
- `data_description.txt`: Metadata and column descriptions for all variables.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing Value Handling
- Label Encoding
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Gradient Boosting)
- Submission CSV generation
